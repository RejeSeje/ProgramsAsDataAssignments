(i)
When comparing ex8 to the handwritten 20mil loop, it is clear that the
bytecode instructions for ex8 are more bloated. Below I have written out the
instructions for each function line for line:

handwritten:
(0 20000000) csti 20mil
(16 7)goto 7 (less than)
(0 1)csti 1
(2)sub
(9)dup
(18)ifnzro
(4)div
(25)stop

ex8:
call 0, "l1"
stop
label "l1"
incsp 1
getbp
(0 0) csti 0
add
csti 20mil
sti 
incsp -1
goto "l3"
label "l2"
getbp
csti 0
add
getbp
csti 0
add
ldi
csti 1
sub
sti
incsp -1
incsp 0
label "l3"
getbp
csti 0
add
ldi
ifnzro "l2"
incsp -1
ret -1

(ii) - we understand this part of the exercise to be a brief
explanation of how loops and conditionals work together in the bytecode
generated:
loops and conditionals works by utilizing labels.
by jumping around to different bytecode instructions
from conditional evaluations. a bit like:
LDI; LT; IFNZRO "L2"
is the effective part of the while loop, returning to L2
unless the condition is not met.
