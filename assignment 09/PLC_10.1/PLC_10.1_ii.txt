Lenght
"hdr >> 2" shifts the 32 bit headers block 2 bits effectively discarding the two right
most bits, the gg part. and then selects last 22 bits by applying the AND
operation with the hexidecimal number 0x003FFFFF which translates to the
binary 000000001111111111111111111111.

Color
"hdr & 3" selects the last 2 bits by applying the AND operation with the
decimal value 3 which corresponds to the binary representation
00000000000000000000000000000011.

Paint
"hdr & -3" clears the last 2 bits (sets them to 00).
and then sets the last 2 bits to the bitvalue of color.
